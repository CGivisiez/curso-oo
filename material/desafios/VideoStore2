Modify the rating calculation in the following way. If the rating count is less than or equal to 4, then nothing is changed. If the rating count is higher than 4, then you are to find the highest rating and lowest rating and discard them (and their counts) when finding the average. You are not to throw away all counts with the Max and Min ratings, just one instance of them. For example, if there are several ratings with the same Max and Min, only 2 ratings are to be discarded.

Example 1:

ratings entered: 1, 2, 4,
rating count = 3
avg =  2.33
Example 2:

ratings entered: 5, 4, 1, 4, 5, 5, 3, 2
rating count = 6 (8 - 2)
discarded Max = 5
discarded Min = 1
avg = 3.83
Example 3:

ratings entered: 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4
rating count = 4 (6 - 2)
discarded Max = 5
discarded Min = 4
avg = 4.75
